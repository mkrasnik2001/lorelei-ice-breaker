I was on my way to the Flughafen in a taxi that had no klimaanlarge!
As I sat there sweating and cursing my luck, I suddenly spotted a random guy strolling down the street in a Dirndl.
It looked as though he was making his way down to Hauptstrasse to purchase some delicious Bratwurst.
I was hungry so I asked the taxi to drop me here as I was going to order the man got into his Bmw and offered me a ride to his Schloss.
I loved the idea, however as soon as i got into his BMW, my Lederhose ripped.
At this point I had realized that I already missed my flight, so I got out of the BMW and decided it was time to go down to the Biergarten, or maybe the Ratskeller. 
Walking into the Biergarten with my ripped Lederhose flapping in the breeze, I was greeted by a cheerful man who handed me a Doener and said, “Nothing fixes a bad day like meat in bread and beer in hand!”
It was then I realized the gentleman beside me became wettbewerbsfähig; as soon as we made eye contact, the race to finish our Gebäck and beer was on!
It was neck and neck, crumbs flying everywhere, until the man suddenly shouted, 'Apfelkuchen for the winner!' and pointed to a nearby Bäckerei.
I started running toward the Bäckerei "I cant lose free dessert" but in my way I tripped when a Hund helped me up
"Thank you!" I said to the hund. His owner got out of his Porsche and invited me to visit his schloss because he saw me trip and felt bad.
As we drove to his schloss in the Porsche, he blasted Rammstein at full volume, and I couldn’t help but feel like their intense music was the perfect soundtrack to my ripped Lederhose adventure.
Unfortunately Rammstein was too heavy for my shirt and that too has ripped, today sucked.
As we arrived at his schloss, I realized it wasn’t just any castle—it was Schloss Eltz, nestled like a fairytale in the hills near Raesfeld.
Inside Schloss Eltz, the kind owner handed me a fresh pair of Lederhose, saying, 'Every great adventure deserves a fitting outfit,' before offering me a slice of Apfelkuchen to brighten my day.
